##Social Media Sentiment Analyzer (Social-Sentiment)

This project is a submission for the Global Hack Week hackathon, under the "Look out, a Snake!" challenge. The goal of the challenge is to create an innovative project using the Python programming language.
#Overview

The Social Media Sentiment Analyzer is a Python-based tool that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiment from social media platforms such as Twitter. By fetching tweets based on a specific query, the tool evaluates the sentiment behind each tweet and categorizes it as positive, negative, or neutral. This can be useful for understanding public opinion on various topics, analyzing trends, and even informing marketing strategies.
# Features
- Fetches tweets based on user-defined keywords
- Analyzes sentiment using TextBlob, a Python library for processing textual data
- Categorizes sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral
- Generates a summary of sentiment analysis results
